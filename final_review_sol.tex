%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 	
\sol
Let $x_{i,j}$ be the $i$th observation resulting from the $j$th group. 
Let the population means of Freshman, Sophomore, Junior classes' studying hours be $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, and $\mu_3$. $n_1=6$, $n_2=6$, and $n_3=7$.\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis\\
    $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$\\
    $H_A:$ At least one population mean is different.\\
    \item Test Statistics\\
    Test statistics: $V.R=\frac{MSA}{MSW}$\\
    \item Rejection Region\\
    $ V.R> F_{1-\alpha,2,16}=3.63$\\
    \item Calculate the statistics\\
    \[SSW=\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(x_{ij}-\bar{x}_{.j})^2=10.6369\]
    \[SSA=\sum_{j=1}^3 n_j(\bar{x}_{.j}-\bar{x}_{..})^2=30.0210\]
    \[MSA=\frac{SSA}{k-1}=\frac{30.0210}{2}=15.0105\]
    \[MSW=\frac{SSW}{N-k}=\frac{10.6369}{16}=0.6648\]
    \[V.R=\frac{15.0105}{0.6648}=22.5787\]
    \item Make Decision \\
    Our computed $V.R= 22.5787$ is greater than $F_{1-\alpha,2,16}=3.63$, so we reject $H_0$.    
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item
\sol This is a two-tailed hypothesis test.

$$V.R. = \frac{S_s^2}{S_w^2} = \frac{64}{16} = 4.$$

The F distribution is not symmetric, so we will need to find $F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}$ 
and $F_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}$

$$F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}=F_{0.95, 12, 15}=2.48.$$
$$F_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}=\frac{1}{F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_2-1,n1-1}}=\frac{1}{F_{0.95, 15, 12}}=\frac{1}{2.62} = 0.3817.$$

The rejection region is $\left[0, 0.3817\right] \cup \left[2.48, \infty\right)$. 
Since $V.R.=4$ is outside the rejection region, we \emph{fail to reject} H$_0$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol This is a one-tailed hypothesis test.

We assume the $H_0$ to be true, thus we put $p_b - p_p=(p_b - p_p)_0=0$ in the test statistic.
Moreover, we must find a common value $\bar{p}$ for the denominator
$$\bar{p} = \frac{28+43}{180+175} = 0.20. $$

$$T.S._{obs} = \frac{(\hat{p}_b-\hat{p}_p)-(p_b - p_p)_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}  (1 - \bar{p})}{n_b}+\frac{\bar{p}  (1 - \bar{p})}{n_p}}} = \frac{(0.2389-0.16)-(0)}{\sqrt{\frac{0.20 \times 0.80}{180} +\frac{0.20 \times 0.80}{175}}} = 1.858 \approx 1.86.$$

Our $p$-value $= 1 - \Phi(z_{obs}) = 1 - \Phi(1.86) = 1 - 0.9686 = 0.0314$. \\Since this value is less than $\alpha = 0.05$, we \emph{reject} H$_0$.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item
\sol This is a one-tailed hypothesis test.

$$ T.S. = \frac{(n-1) S^2}{\sigma^2_0}$$
$$\chi_{obs}^2= \frac{(n-1)  s^2}{\sigma^2_0} = \frac{29 \times (0.09)}{0.14} = 18.64.$$

Find the value for $\chi_{n-1,\alpha}^2$ = $\chi_{29, 0.05}^2 = 17.708.$
Because $18.64 > 17.708$, it is not in the rejection region, and we \emph{fail to reject} H$_0$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item
	
\sol This is a two-tailed hypothesis test.

$$z_{obs} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{69.2 - 68}{\frac{3.6}{\sqrt{36}}} = \frac{1.2}{\frac{3.6}{6}} = \frac{1.2}{0.6} = 2.0.$$

Our $p$-value $= 2 \times (1 - \Phi(z_{obs})) = 2 \times (1 - \Phi(2.0)) = 2 \times (1 - 0.9772) = 2 \times 0.0228 = 0.0456$. Since this value is greater than $\alpha = 0.01$, we \emph{fail to reject} H$_0$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
	
\sol This is a two-tailed hypothesis test. Since we do not know the variances but they are equal, we use a $t$-distribution, and need $s_p^2$:

$$ s_p^2 = \frac{(n_A - 1)(s_A^2)+ (n_B -1)(s_B^2)}{n_A+n_B-2} = \frac{194.75}{25} \approx 7.79.$$

Also note that $t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_A+n_B-2} = t_{.99,25} = 2.485$, so $t_{.01,25} = -2.485$. 
Since, we assume the null hypothesis to be true, $\mu_A - \mu_B=0$,  
$$t_{obs} = \frac{(\bar{x}_A-\bar{x}_B)-(\mu_A - \mu_B)_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_A}+\frac{s_p^2}{n_B}}} = \frac{-4 - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{7.79}{15}+\frac{7.79}{12}}} = \frac{-4}{1.0810} \approx -3.67.$$

Since this observed $t$-value is in the rejection region, and we \emph{reject} H$_0$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item

\sol The confidence interval of the ratio of two population variances $\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}$ is
	
$\left(\frac{s_1^2/s_2^2}{F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-2}},\frac{s_1^2/s_2^2}{F_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-2}}\right)$ where $n_1=20, n_2=15$ and $s_1^2=100$, $s_2^2=120$.\\
	

For the 95\% confidence interval, $\alpha$ is 0.05.
		
Since $F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}=F_{0.975,19,14}=2.86$,
		
and $F_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n_1-1,n_2-1}=\frac{1}{F_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_2-1,n1-1}}=\frac{1}{F_{0.975,14,19}}=\frac{1}{2.65}$, the confidence interval of the ratio of two population variances is
		
$\left(\frac{100/120}{2.86},\frac{100/120}{1/2.65}\right)=\left(0.2914, 2.2083\right)$;\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 8 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
	\sol
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $\alpha \geq 0.001$.
	\item $\alpha < 0.001$.	
	\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 9 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol Yes. The sample mean of any underlying population distribution for size $n > 30$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ by the central limit theorem.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 10 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol No. The population is not normally distributed, and the sample is too small to apply the central limit 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 11 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol The $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval of the difference of population means is given by $$\left(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - t_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2},n_1 + n_2 - 2} \times \sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_p^2}{n_2}},\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 + t_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2},n_1 + n_2 - 2} \times \sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_p^2}{n_2}}\right)$$ where $$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2+(n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}.$$\\
Note that in this problem, students should realize $s_p = s_1 = s_2 = 0.5$.
The degrees of freedom $ df= n_1+n_2-2=16+25-2=39$. We do not have the table for $df=39$, thus we use values for $df=40$. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $CI_{95} = (6 - 5.5 - 2.0211 \times 0.16, 6 - 5.5 + 2.0211 \times 0.16) = (0.1766,0.8234)$.
	\item $CI_{90} = (6 - 5.5 - 1.6839 \times 0.16, 6 - 5.5 + 1.6839 \times 0.16) = (0.2306,0.7694)$.
	\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 12 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol\\
Here, $n=20, p=0.25$, thus $\mu=np=5$, and $\sigma^2=np(1-p)=20\times 0.25 \times 0.75=3.75.$
The continuity correction factor requires us to use 7.5 in order to include 8 since the inequality is weak and we want the region to the right.
\begin{align*}
P(X\geq 8) &\approx P\left(Z\geq \frac{7.5-\mu}{\sigma}\right) =P\left(Z\geq \frac{7.5-5}{\sqrt{3.75}}\right) \\
&=P(Z\geq 1.29)\\
&=1-P(Z\leq 1.29)\\
&=1-0.9015\\
&=0.0985.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 13 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\sol
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\mu_{\hat{p}} = 0.30$
\item $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.30\times 0.70}{50}} = 0.0648$
\item 
\begin{align*}
P(\, \hat{p} \geq 0.4) &= P\left(Z \geq \frac{0.4-0.3}{0.0648}\right) \\
&= P(Z \geq 1.5432)\\&=1-P(Z \leq 1.5432) \\
&= 1-0.9382\\&=0.0168.
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
